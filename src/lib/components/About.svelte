	<h2>About</h2>
	<h1>Hey, I'm Your Name</h1>
	<hr />

	<p>
		I am a software engineer passionate about building products that matter. Currently, I am
		working on <a href="https://example.com">exciting projects</a> at the intersection of technology
		and design.
	</p>

	<p>
		Previously, I worked on full-stack applications at
		<a href="https://example.com">Company A</a> and contributed to open-source tools at
		<a href="https://example.com">Company B</a>. I studied Computer Science at
		<a href="https://example.com">University</a>, where I focused on systems programming and
		human-computer interaction.
	</p>

	<p>
		Outside of work, I enjoy photography, reading, and exploring new places. The small details in
		how things are built fascinate me, whether it's software architecture or a well-designed
		building.
